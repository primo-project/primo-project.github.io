        <p>PRIMO stands for PRIvacy and MObility. It is a research project that is part of the program Sharing of Tools 
            for Processing and Analysing Mobility Data of the France 2030 framework on Data Technology for Mobility in the 
            Territories.
        </p>

        <p>PRIMO investigates how user data is collected and exploited through smartphone apps developed to support 
            green mobility practices, from navigation to trip planning or ticket reservation and electric vehicle charging.
        </p>

        <p>PRIMO focuses on two key components of sustainability: the environment, *i.e.,* to develop digital tools that 
        can support people in transitioning to practices that reduce the environmental footprint, and the social welfare, 
        *i.e.,* to make sure that digital tools enable users to retain ownership on their personal data.
        </p>

        <p>PRIMO combines research methods from computer science to collect and analyze technical data related to privacy 
        and social science to understand the perception of users with respect to the protection of their personal data. 
        </p>

        <p>The objective of PRIMO is to design a user-friendly privacy information model for mobility smartphone apps that 
        help apps' users become more familiar with how their personal data is exploited.
        </p>

        <p>We are currently looking for volunteers to take part in short interviews about privacy awareness and focus-groups 
        around scenario making. Please get in touch via our contact details available at ... if you are interested in 
        participating!  </p>
