		<p>PRIMO stands for PRIvacy and MObility. It is a research project that is part of the program Sharing of Tools 
            for Processing and Analysing Mobility Data of the France 2030 framework on Data Technology for Mobility in the 
            Territories.
        </p>

        <p>PRIMO investigates how user data is collected and exploited through smartphone apps developed to support 
            green mobility practices, from navigation to trip planning or ticket reservation and electric vehicle charging.
        </p>
		
		<p>The objective of PRIMO is to design a user-friendly privacy information model for mobility smartphone apps that 
        help apps' users become more familiar with how their personal data is exploited.
        </p>

        <p>We are currently looking for volunteers to take part in short interviews about privacy awareness and focus-groups 
        around scenario making. Please get in touch via our contact details available at <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> 
	if you are interested in participating!  </p>
